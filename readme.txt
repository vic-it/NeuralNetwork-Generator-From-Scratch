This is a neural network framework made from scratch.
Made with python + numpy (no neural network libraries used)
Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@independentcod

It features fordward and backwards propagation for different layers and methods such as:
- Dense Layer
- Noise Layer
- ReLU Layer
- SoftMax Layer
- Cross Entropy
- MSE

as well as the option to train, store and load networks.

The data directory consists of the data preprocessing for different training sets (i.e. mnist, iris, ...).

The main goal consisted of getting a deeper and firmer understanding of the practical implementation of neural networks as well as more experience with python.
